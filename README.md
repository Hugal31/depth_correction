# depth_correction

ROS kinetic nodelet

## Dependencies

- [rgbd_calibration](https://github.com/iaslab-unipd/rgbd_calibration) or [my fork](https://github.com/Hugal31/rgbd_calibration).

## How to use it

- The nodelet reads a F32C1 depth image on the topic `~image` and output a correct F32C1 depth image on the topic `~image_rect`.
- It needs two parameters, global_und_matrix and local_und_matrix which points on the files generated by rgbd_calibration.
- You can also launch the .launch file, that setup the pipeline to create the corrected point cloud with the help of `depth_image_proc`.
